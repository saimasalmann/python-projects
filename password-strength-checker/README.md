# 🔐 Project 02: Password Strength Checker

## Objective

 **Password Strength Checker** in Python  evaluates a user’s password based on security rules. The program will:

- Analyze passwords based on **length, character types, and patterns**.
- Assign a **strength score** (*Weak, Moderate, Strong*).
- Provide **feedback** to improve weak passwords.
- Use **control flow, type casting, strings, and functions**.

---

##  Requirements

### 1. Password Strength Criteria

A strong password should:
✅ Be at least **8 characters long**  
✅ Contain **uppercase & lowercase letters**  
✅ Include at least **one digit (0-9)**  
✅ Have **one special character** (*@#$%^&*!)  

### 2. Scoring System

- **Weak (Score: 1-2)** → Short, missing key elements  
- **Moderate (Score: 3)** → Good but missing some security features  
- **Strong (Score: 4)** → Meets all criteria  

### 3. Feedback System

- If the password is **weak**,  improvements will be given.  
- If the password is **strong**, will display a success message.
